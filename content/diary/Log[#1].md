So it begins... An official record of my software development journey. 

<!-- Optional: Use Hugo's summary divider -->
<!--more-->

Inasmuch as substantial ground has been covered, prior to this... I hope you can tag along, there's still a lot more to discover.

### What To Expect:

This section serves as a glimpse into my **thought process** and **approach** to the **{{< pagelink "projects" "projects" >}}** I feature here. I delve into **greater detail** on how existing versions are conceived, designed, tested and refined (or modified **entirely**).

I plan to reflect on **pitfalls**, **things learned** and the **way forward** as well. I believe this is paramount as it serves as a **guidepost** for those to soon tread this path, lest they run into the same hurdle(s). Moreover, a reminder for myself and others not to relive said ordeal(s).

### Closing Remarks:

**{{< pagelink "about" "Yours truly" >}}** shall strive to update this section as frequently as possible. For any **queries** and **feedback**, feel free to **{{< pagelink "contact" "reach out" >}}**.
